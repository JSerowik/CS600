Moody's Chief Economist Mark Zandi told CNBC on Wednesday his high-profile reports criticizing Donald Trump 's economic policies and praising Hillary Clinton 's were not influenced by his personal politics.
Zandi said on "Squawk Box" he's not part of the Clinton campaign.
"I'm a registered 'D,' I'm a Democrat. And I have contributed to [Clinton's] campaign in the primary," he said. "But I've contributed to 'Rs' and I've worked on the McCain campaign. So I've worked both sides of the aisle."
Zandi advised Sen. John McCain's 2008 GOP presidential campaign.
In a new report , Zandi and his colleagues wrote: If all of Clinton's stated policies become law in the manner proposed, "real GDP would be 1.7 percent larger" by the end of her term, with 3.2 million more jobs .
In June , Moody's released a highly critical analysis of Trump's economic policies, writing at the time: If all of the real estate mogul's policies were adopted, the economy would suffer a "lengthy recession," with 3.5 million fewer jobs.
"This isn't about actually what will happen [politically], it's about what they say they want to get done," Zandi said Wednesday.
Clinton trumpeted the Moody's analysis in this week's rally with billionaire investor Warren Buffett in Nebraska.
"In the case of the Clinton campaign, they are very transparent. The problem modeling the Clinton economic policies is that there's a lot of policies. And there's a lot of moving parts," Zandi said.
